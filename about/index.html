                   <i>Omomys</i> (fig. 2.1) was a genus of small, nocturnal ancestral primates that lived during the Eocene epoch (55-33 million years ago). Weighing less than a pound, <i>Omomys</i> subsisted on insects, fruit, and tree-sap. Today, <i>Omomyid</i> fossils are found throughout the American West, Europe, and Asia.<sup>1</sup>

                    Lauren is a <i>Homo sapiens sapiens</i> (fig 2.2) living in Seattle, WA in the Holocene epoch (11,700 years ago-present). As a member of the genus <i>Homo</i>, she is diurnal, bipedal, and capable of cognitive thinking. Her diet consists mostly of coffee, and she has specialized hands capable of grasping, typing, and doodling. She is currently learning to code, but also quite likes paleoanthropology.
