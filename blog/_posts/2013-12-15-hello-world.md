Hi, thanks for checking out my blog! I made this website to track my progress learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other languages I bump into along the way while I explore web design. This is the very first site I have built from sketch to completion. So far, I have basic HTML/CSS skills (which I will be improving upon!) and Iâ€™m starting to learn JavaScript. Until a few months ago, I had never coded anything or thought twice about the way websites are made.

I built this site with HTML5 Boilerplate (cool!) and Jekyll (ugh).  I got this far with the help of Girl Develop It classes and Treehouse. Over the next few months I would like hone my front end development skills and use them to create a couple of awesome websites and maybe even apps. I would also like to start learning a bit about design and UX. Good luck to me, I guess!
